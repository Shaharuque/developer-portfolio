        <h2>Hi, Iâ€™m Amin. Nice to meet you.</h2>
        <p>Since beginning my journey as a freelance designer nearly 10 years ago, I've done remote work for agencies, consulted for startups, and collaborated with talented people to create digital products for both business and consumer use. I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on improving my chops one design problem at a time.

        <h2>Become a web Developer</h2>
        <p>Web developers can be split into two different areas of responsibilities and skills - frontend and backend. Frontend developers focus on programming languages such as HTML, CSS and Javascript to create the visual and interactive parts of a website - essentially the parts you can see.Backend developers are responsible for creating the logic that runs on a server which typically involves communicating with a database and manipulating data, before passing it back to the browser and presenting to the user. Typical programming languages used are PHP, Ruby, ASP are SQL.
